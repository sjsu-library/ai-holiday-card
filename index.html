                The story behind the Artificial Intelligence assisted design of SJSU King Library‚Äôs 2023 Holiday card
            </h2>
            <p>
                The team was tasked by Dean of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mike Meth, with creating artwork that represents SJSU King Library as a future facing institution. A brainstorming session resulted in the team deciding on the idea of artwork being generated by Artificial Intelligence. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                SJSU King Library‚Äôs Technology Labs Coordinator Jon Oakes was brought onto the project to provide consultation on how artificial intelligence image generation models worked, and which artificial intelligence models to use - with ethical considerations in mind. The decision to use Style GAN was in large part because generated results would be constrained to Van Gogh‚Äôs art style, and that Van Gogh‚Äôs artworks were public domain.

            <p>
                Created by researchers at Nvidia, Style Generative Adversarial Network is a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/machine%20learning" target="_blank">machine learning framework</a>. The AI Discriminator refers to Van Gogh‚Äôs library of paintings as a benchmark to measure the results produced by the AI image generator. Under the guidance of the AI Discriminator, the AI image generator iterates millions of results until a result satisifies the benchmark set by the AI Discriminator.

            <p class="text-box-wide">
                Pulling inspiration from the AI generated image, the Library Marketing Team (LMT) came together to design a holiday card and a digital copy with motion and animations. Using Adobe Illustrator, LMT decided to extend the image to the back cover with the continuous swirl, giving it the illusion of motion while also staying true to the original image. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                From there the team extracted the blues from the skyline for the background and text to give the overall design a cohesive look and feel. With a touch of ‚ÄòSpartan Pride‚Äô (font), the card was officially completed and arrived straight to your mailbox! üíå

                ‚ÄúAI has come on pretty fast in the past year and we're looking at ways to take advantage of this powerful technology ethically and responsibly.  There's a risk in adopting new technology tools blindly so we want to explore and try things as much as we can and challenge each other.  But what we were able to do with AI was beyond this skills and time we had to do this manually so it ended up surprisingly great and we feel confident that the use of AI technology in this instance was respectful of the source material, the artists involved and produced a good product.‚Äù
